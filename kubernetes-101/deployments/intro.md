# ReplicaSets and Deployments

This scenario takes you through the basics of ReplicaSets and Deployments in Kubernetes. 

- to **deploy** a **ReplicaSet**
- to **scale** your **ReplicaSet**
- to **create** a **Deployment** 
- to **rollout** a new **ReplicaSet** 

The official Kubernetes documentation is quite good and has a couple of examples. Feel free to read more about [ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) and [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
